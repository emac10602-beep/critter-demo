# How to Build & Run the Critter 3D Platformer Demo on Mac (DSi/DS)

## 1. Install devkitPro and nds-dev
Open Terminal and install the devkitPro package manager if you don’t have it yet:

    brew install devkitpro-pacman

Then install the Nintendo DS development libraries:

    sudo dkp-pacman -S nds-dev

This sets up devkitARM (the compiler) and libnds.

---

## 2. Create a Project Folder
In Terminal:

    mkdir critter_demo
    cd critter_demo

Inside, create the folder structure:

    critter_demo/
     ├── Makefile
     └── source/
          └── main.c

---

## 3. Add the Code
- Save the big code I gave you into `source/main.c`.
- For the `Makefile`, copy it from the template that comes with devkitPro:
  
      cp /opt/devkitpro/examples/nds/template/Makefile ./Makefile

(That path might differ depending on installation; look inside `/opt/devkitpro/examples/nds/`).

---

## 4. Build the ROM
In Terminal, from the project folder:

    make

If successful, you will see an output file:

    critter_demo.nds

This is your playable ROM.

---

## 5. Run the ROM
### Option A – Emulator
- Install **melonDS** or **DeSmuME** on your Mac.
- Drag-and-drop `critter_demo.nds` into the emulator to play instantly.

### Option B – On a DSi XL
- Install **TWiLight Menu++** on your DSi SD card.
- Copy `critter_demo.nds` onto the SD card (e.g., into a `roms` folder).
- Boot TWiLight Menu++, select the file, and run it.

---

## 6. Play Controls
- D-Pad = move  
- A = Jump / Glide  
- B = Swat (attack)  
- L/R = Orbit camera  
- Y = Quick turn  
- START = Reset to checkpoint  

Collect glowing cubes, swat bug-bots, climb rooftops to the beacon.

---

That’s it! You’ve now got a working 3D platformer demo running on DSi hardware or Mac emulator.
